{"What Are ANGEL NUMBERS?": "ANGEL NUMBERS - What are They? The phenomena of 'Number Sequences', sometimes known as 'Angel Numbers' is becoming more and more prevalent day by day. Thousands upon thousands of people from all walks of life, from all parts of the world, and from every creed and religion, are reporting the phenomena of noticing particular number sequences on clocks, timers, car number plates, billboards, and from all kinds of sources. According to respected authors, therapists and spiritualists around the world, this phenomenon is occurring as a new\u00a0Spiritual Awareness\u00a0is taking place and gaining momentum on our planet. As a race, people are evolving on a Spiritual level, with the number sequences being 'messages' from a Higher Source. Your\u00a0angels\u00a0(and/or\u00a0spirit guides) guide you through your thoughts, feelings, words and visions. They also show you \u2018signs\u2019 - that is, things that you see repeatedly with your physical eyes. One of the signs is repetitive number sequences. Angels\u00a0and those of the spiritual realm do their best to get our attention and to communicate with us. In this way, they help us heal our own lives. However, we often discount the signs that they give us, writing them off as mere coincidences or our imagination.\" Your\u00a0angels\u00a0often communicate messages to you by showing you sequences of numbers. They do this in two ways. First, they subtly whisper in your ear so that you will look up in time to notice the time displayed on the clock, or the phone number on an advertisement or something similar. The\u00a0angels\u00a0hope that you will be aware and acknowledge that you are seeing this same sequence of numbers, over and over. The second way in which the\u00a0angels\u00a0show you meaningful number sequences' is by physically arranging for something like a car driving in front of you that has specific number plates, and hope that you realize that you are seeing the number sequence again. They want you to notice, then look into the messages further. When you notice a particular number sequence recurring for you, ask the\u00a0angels\u00a0what they are trying to tell you, and you will find that your\u00a0angels\u00a0will give you additional information. Monitor your thoughts carefully, and be sure to only think about what you want, not what you don't want. The great Pythagoras said that everything in the Universe is mathematically precise, and that each number has its own vibration and meaning. The placement of the numbers in a sequence holds special meaning. Numerology\u00a0is a sacred science that has maintained its relevance from ancient to modern times. Numbers point out the importance of seeing \u2018messages\u2019 three- dimensionally, in order to show us the lessons, growth opportunities and guidance contained with each experience. As you recognize and interpret the numbers around you, you may feel more connected to the\u00a0angels. This connection allows the angels to open the door to an incredible connection that brings peace, hope and love. Number sequence interpretation is an easy way to receive\u00a0messages from your angels. Numerals are everywhere, from digital clocks to license plates. Each number has a vibrational frequently relating directly to its meaning. The\u00a0angels\u00a0always seek to give us\u00a0guidance\u00a0and answers. When they call our attention to number sequences, it is a positive sign of their devotion, love and power. When you notice a number sequence, listen to your\u00a0angel\u2019s guidance\u00a0that comes through your feelings, visions and thoughts. The more you notice these signs, the more frequently they will appear in your life. Once you understand the \u2018signs\u2019 meanings and accept that they are not mere \u2018coincidences\u2019, but important and purposeful events and messages, you will experience a close and clear communication with your\u00a0angels. You will discover spiritual signs and messages all around you, all the time. You may also notice number sequences that signify things of personal significance, such as birth dates, anniversaries, telephone numbers etc. In these cases the\u00a0angels\u00a0are giving you an even deeper, pertinent and personal message. The recurrence of number sequences is a subtle and constant reminder that something magical \u2026 something Divine is happening. When you see the number sequences (\u2018Angel Numbers\u2019), acknowledge that the angels are telling you that you are on your true path, and say \u2018Thank You\u2019 to them for communicating with you. The\u00a0Angel Numbers\u00a0are messages for us - best we heed them. The main thing about seeing and acknowledging the repeating number sequences or Angel Numbers is the fact that you are consciously seeing them. At this time, your angels are communicating directly with YOU. The messages are for YOU and they are about YOU and YOUR life ... \u00a0It is up to YOU to take the time to go within, listen to your intuition and true self, and figure out what the message/s are telling YOU and what they mean to YOU. \u00a0Only you know what lies within you ... Your highest guidance is unique for you and you have all of your own answers within you.

One way that our angels attract our attention is by showing us physical signs, such as repeating number sequences, which can appear in all manner of places. Numbers are all around us in our everyday lives, so it is not difficult for the angels to arrange them in a fashion that we take notice of. When we recognize and interpret the repeating number sequences around us, we are able to feel more connected to our spirit guides and angels. This connection allows us to open the door to our inspiring and powerful connection to the angelic realm, which brings about clarity, hope, peace and love.

Once we learn to blend the higher-self with our daily thinking pattern, we will learn how to avoid the obstacles and\u00a0pitfalls experienced when we operate fully on a materialistic level. \u00a0As we learn to blend the two levels we mature and develop\u00a0spiritually. \u00a0It makes us grow stronger and develop an inner-strength that will help us to steer our lives in the right\u00a0direction. \u00a0Balance within gives us great strength to our character. \u00a0The essence of the message of the number sequence of 11 is to develop intuition, clairvoyance, spiritual healing and\u00a0metaphysical faculties. \u00a0The Number 11 symbolizes the principle of spiritual enlightenment. When Angel Number\u00a011 appears repeatedly in your life your angels are asking you to pay attention to your repetitive thoughts and ideas as\u00a0they hold the \u2018answers\u2019 to your prayers. When you recognize an Angel Number 111 sequence appearing to you frequently, take note of your thoughts at the time that they occur.\u00a0When a series of 111's appear, monitor your thoughts carefully and be sure to only think about what it is you really want,\u00a0not what you don't want. The 1111 sequences is most often the first sequence that appears to many people. \u00a0Once the 1111 is noticed and\u00a0acknowledged, the number sequences progress onto other numbers and your angels have other messages to pass on to you. \u00a0The 1111 number sequence is a sign that there is an opportunity opening up for you, and your thoughts are manifesting them\u00a0into form at lightening speed. \u00a0The 1111 is similar to the bright light of a flashbulb. \u00a0It means that the Universe has just taken\u00a0a snapshot of your thoughts and is manifesting your ideas into material form.\u00a0Be aware that you will manifest your thoughts, therefore, do not think negative thoughts as these are what you will draw\u00a0into your life. Use the positive energies of the Universe to bring to fruition your deepest desires, hopes and dreams.
